                    Practical Christianity
                    Human Dignity
                    Excellence
                    We believe Christianity is not a myth. God's word preached must bring truths that can produce results when applied to one’s life.

                    Every human being is created in the image and likeness of God and must be treated with respect and honour. Also, everything the Christian or the human being will do must be in excellent shape to the glory of God. (Daniel 5:12)

                    <div className="space-y-5">
                        <p>
                        The International Central Gospel Church (ICGC) was founded by Rev. Dr. Mensa Otabil on the 26th February, 1984 in Ghana, West Africa, as an evangelical charismatic church.
                    </p>

                       <p>
                             From February 1984 to April 1986, the membership grew to about one hundred and eighty (180) adults in regular attendance. The early meetings of the church were held in several facilities which included classrooms, a private residence, a public hall, a science laboratory, a mechanical workshop and a cinema theatre.
                       </p>

                            <p>
                                In May 1986, the church settled in a rented Norge scout hall – the Baden Powell Memorial Hall – which became its home for the next ten years.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                During this ten-year period, the membership rose to over 4,000. This period also saw aggressive missionary church planting activities with local assemblies established in almost all the major towns and cities of Ghana.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                From a humble beginning with a handful of people in its maiden meeting, the church has now grown into multidimensional Christian ministries represented in various parts of the world and touching lives and nations with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Today about 1150 ICGC branches had been established in Africa, Europe, Canada and the United States.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In 1988, the ICGC established a ministerial institute to train a new generation of leaders to carry out its vision. From the initial six-month certificate in ministry, the college has developed into the premier private-owned University in Ghana known as the Central University.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                 Again in 1988, the church instituted an educational scholarship scheme, known as Central Aid, to finance the education of selected needy students in pre-tertiary educational institutions. This scheme is now considered the largest non-governmental scholarship programme for students in pre-tertiary education in Ghana.
                            </p>

                        <p>
                             ICGC is in the forefront of human development in a holistic way. This is expressed in raising credible spirit filled and godly leaders in all facets of life including pastoral ministry, business, education, and public-spirited persons for national and continental development.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            ICGC is clear on its commitment; to uphold the sanctity of human life through spiritual and ethical behavior, to raise godly people through pastoral ministry, and to model leadership of integrity and excellence. In view of that, the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ is made relevant to all people.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is exemplified by the message of its leader, Rev. Dr. Otabil, who through the Living Word Broadcast, which is aired across parts of Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, continue to give hope to all who believe that there is indeed a future for them. To the praise of our Lord Jesus Christ, ICGC remains a torchbearer for global transformation!
